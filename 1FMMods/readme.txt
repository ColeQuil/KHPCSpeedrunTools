How to use:
- Extract and run LuaBackend.exe while 1FM is running
- Command line program should open, stating that it initialized script successfully.

SaveAnywhere:
- In-game, press L1+L2+R2+Select (or equivalent on your input device)
- You can use this to essentially soft reset by going to title screen
- You can use this to save anywhere. Saving during cutscenes or combat may have unexpected consequences.
- You can access the normal menu through here as well. I have not tested all interactions
- I have prevented opening save menus on top of each other to prevent crashing

InstantGummi:
- Instantly arrive at any selected world
- Warp points are disabled
- Warp drive is disabled (it'd be slower)
- Attempting to travel to Halloween Town or Atlantica will take you to Monstro if it has not yet been visited
- To go to Hollow Bastion 2, select the warp point that takes you there

CutsceneSkip:
- Allows skipping unskippable cutscenes (Wonderland, HB2)
- Allows skipping cutscenes earlier (Riku waking up at HB)
- Can not skip text boxes or "mini cutscenes" such as drinking enlarge/shrink potions in Wonderland

FasterDialogAnims:
- Speeds up text boxes and "mini cutscenes" as well as room transitions
- Also speeds up summon animations. If you don't want that, replace "summonSpeedup = true" with "summonSpeedup = false"
- Default speed multiplier is 3.0, but you can change it to anything you like
