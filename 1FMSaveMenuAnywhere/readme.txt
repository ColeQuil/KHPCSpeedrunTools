How to use:
- Extract and run LuaBackEnd.exe while 1FM is running
- Command line program should open, stating that it initialized script successfully. It will also print Sora's HP as a test (0 in title screen).
- In-game, press L1+L2+R2+Select (or equivalent on your input device)

Remarks:
- You can use this to essentially soft reset by going to title screen
- You can use this to save anywhere. Saving during cutscenes or combat may have unexpected consequences.
- You can access the normal menu through here as well. I have not tested all interactions
- I have prevented opening save menus on top of each other to prevent crashing
