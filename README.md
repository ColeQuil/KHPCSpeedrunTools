How to use:

Download files from the repository (ex. click the green Code button and download the repository as zip)

## 1FM and 2FM mods
Get LuaBackend here https://github.com/Topaz-Reality/LuaBackend/releases/ and place the LuaBackend.exe into those folders, next to config.ini and scripts folder. Then, launch it while the game is running. Read the corresponding readme for details.

Pick and choose scripts to enable. Any .lua files under scripts folder will run.

2FM mods have separate scripts for JP. Only have the JP script in scripts folder if you use that version.

Alternatively, you can use the internal version of LuaBackend. That requires patching the game .exe, but allows it to automatically work in the background without an external program. See LuaBackend documentation for more.

## Load removers
Add scriptable auto splitter into your Livesplit layout, and select the .asl file for your game. Make sure you have a timer that shows game time.
