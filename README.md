How to use:

Download files from the repository (ex. click the green Code button and download the repository as zip)

## 1FMSaveMenuAnywhere and 2FMSoftReset 
Get LuaBackend here https://github.com/Topaz-Reality/LuaBackend/releases/ and place the LuaBackend.exe into those folders. Then, launch it while the game is running. Read the corresponding readme for details.

2FMSoftReset has a separate script for JP. It should work fine to keep them both there to cover both options, but can also just pick the one you use.

Alternatively, you can use the internal version of LuaBackend. That requires patching the game .exe, but allows it to automatically work in the background without an external program. See LuaBackend documentation for more.

## Load removers
Add scriptable auto splitter into your Livesplit layout, and select the .asl file for your game. Make sure you have a timer that shows game time.
